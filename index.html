                    <p class="review-text">"A very nice spot for a sundowner. The surrounding environment is serene, overlooking Mtwapa creek, the mangroves bring to life the place and the Creek as well. The customer service is top notch, good food and friendly staff. How to get there, Alight at Shanzu, take a motorbike to the restaurant. If from Bamburi, Go to Bamburi Mwisho, take a tuktuk going to Shanzu and alight at a place called Matairini. From there, take a motorbike to the restaurant. It is still a work in progress, but so far so good. Go for the food and drinks, beautiful sunset, good company and beautiful views. A nice place to host private parties."</p>

                    <p class="review-text">"One thing that is amazing with this place is the views one gets to experience while here. So, ambience is definitely a 100✅️.On the food, we ordered several platters and the meat was done so well and tender enough. We had also ordered several ugalis with wet fry, the ugali had to be left untouched since the wet fry wasn't wet enough as expected. The mboga/greens was however nicely cooked. Therefore, the food was generally okay. Getting to the restaurant was a bit hectic since it's located deep inside of Shanzu but the good thing is that maps works just fine. If on public means, just take tuktuks plying the Shanzu route, alight at Anex then take a bike to Peninsula."</p>
